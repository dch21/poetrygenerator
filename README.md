# Medicore English Major (Working title) 

# Background and Overview

With the rise of GPT-3, computers can now generate text that is indistinguishable and better written than text produced by most English language speakers. The ability of GPT-3 to “learn” from literally every major text in the English language marks the beginning of the end for most mediocre English majors. How can they ever compete against the machine that has every part of the canon as its disposal?  

The answer, of course, is to join the machines. Mediocre English Major is a tool that lets writers harness the power of technology to produce original writing.
