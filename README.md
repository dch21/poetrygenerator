# Background and Overview

# Editor Toolbox

### Text Manipulation Tools

Writers can submit their original text or pieces that already have been written by others. This can include text such as poems, prose, recipes, articles, or historical documents. Verserly allows you to play around and explore the language of any piece of written text. Once submitted, the text appears in the editor. 

Users can then change the font style and size. They can also edit or clear the text. If more space is needed, they can increase the canvas space by width and size. 

### Erasure/Blackout Poetry Mode

Writers can create Erasure/Blackout Poetry using a variety of erasure filters. Users can click on a letter or word to make it disappear with a variety of settings, including blacked out, whited out, strike through, and fade-out. 

3) Use of [Datemuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) to generate text and substitute words for inspiration. 

Writers can enter a word and have the wessite generate rhymes, synonyms, antonyms, related words, homophones, and more. Users can also enter in a noun and have the generator return related adjectives and vice versa. 

4) The editor also features sample creations that showcase the possbilites of the editor.
