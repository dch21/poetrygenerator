### Text Manipulation Tools

Writers can submit their original text or pieces that already have been written by others. This can include text such as poems, prose, recipes, articles, or historical documents. Verserly allows you to play around and explore the language of any piece of written text. Once submitted, the text appears in the editor. 

Users can then change the font style and size. They can also edit or clear the text. If more space is needed, they can increase the canvas space by width and size. 

### Erasure/Blackout Poetry Mode

Writers can create [Erasure](https://poets.org/glossary/erasure) / [Blackout](https://trishhopkinson.com/2018/06/10/6-styles-of-erasure-poetry-guest-blog-post-by-erin-dorney/) Poetry using a variety of erasure filters.
